## Hit Counter - Motion Canvas

First project using [Motion Canvas](//github.com/motion-canvas/motion-canvas), code pretty messy and audio was no included due to file size.

This project assume font [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) and [JetBrains Mono](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono) already installed on your system.
